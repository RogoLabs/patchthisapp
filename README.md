# PatchThis.app

PatchThis.app is now a static HTML site. It provides a curated list of CVEs that organizations should prioritize for remediation from the following high-quality open-source data sources:

- [CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)
- [Metasploit Modules](https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/modules/)
- [Project Discovery Nuclei Templates](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates)
- [EPSS](https://www.first.org/epss/) Vulnerabilities Scoring Above .95 (on a 0.0 to 1.0 scale)

The site no longer uses Jekyll or any static site generator. All content is managed as static HTML, CSS, and supporting files.
